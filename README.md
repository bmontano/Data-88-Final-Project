# Data-88-Final-Project

Welcome to my final project! 

Status on the project so far: 
I processed the text of the novel I am studying, "A Passage to India" by E. M. Forester and found its lexical diversity. Then I went on to segment the text by sentence. Within each sentence, I calculated the total number of positive and negative words and the proportion of such words in the sentence as a whole. 
Now I have to plot these points and move on to concrete words!
